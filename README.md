# EightAM - Asteroids

Team EightAM recreated the classic multidirectional shooter arcade game "Asteroids", originally released in 1979 by Atari, Inc., for a 3-week long school project. Now we aim to transform the original framework into a successful Play Store game that will give both retro and arcade shooter fans enjoyment.
